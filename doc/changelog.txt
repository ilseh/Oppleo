Fixed
- Install from front-end failed on stopping the Oppleo service.
- NOTE: Due to changes in the call to the install script (flaskRoutes.py) the install script cannot be run from the front end successfully. Run 'install/install.sh' from the command line in the '/home/pi/Oppleo' folder to apply this update succesfully.

- NOTE: Due to changes in the install script (install.sh uses a different requirements.txt filename) the install script must be run twice. This first run will install the correct install.sh script, the second run will run that correct script.
